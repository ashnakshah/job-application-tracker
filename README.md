💼 Job Application Tracker

A full-stack web application that helps users track and manage job applications through different stages of the hiring process.

🚀 Live Demo

---

📌 Overview

This project allows users to:

* Add job applications with company and role details
* Track application status (Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected)
* Update status dynamically without page reload
* Delete applications
* View all applications in a clean, organized UI

---

🧠 Motivation

Managing multiple job applications can get messy quickly.
I built this tool to create a simple, centralized way to track progress and stay organized during the job search process.
